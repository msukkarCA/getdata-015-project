## Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
This is the repository for my Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project files.


## Setting up the environment

The code in run_analysis.R should be at the root directory

## The R script

From here, you can execute the run_analysis.R file against the data.

### Obtaining the data and getting required packages:
This is achieved inside the script itself in the s0init function which will:

* download the zip file to a temp file
* extract and read the required data files
* delete the temp file

### The project 5 steps are then executed sequentially in the script using included helper functions

## The Code Book

The Code Book for this project is also included to provide detailed workings of the analysis and description of the data being analyzed.
